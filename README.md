# froyo
python setup utility for nintendo switch SD cards (installs any version of atmosphere and hekate and pulls latest from their gits!)

- it'll (hopefully) set up your SD card for you
- currently it will only do stuff to ./test/ 

## how to use:

- unzip froyo & run "RUNME.ps1" 
- will automatically activate it's venv and run froyo
- select your packages and select your versions

## what it has:

- atmosphere (may not be able to download some older versions)
- hekate (may not be able to download some older versions)
- sigpatches (older versions not available)

## ideas for the future

- update existing stuff on your sd card
- install apps
- preset installs (specific blocking stuff, preset apps for specific needs)
